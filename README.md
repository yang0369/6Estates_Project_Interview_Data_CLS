# About This Project

This project is an interview assignment with a binary sentiment analysis problem.

To address the stated problem, I have tempted to resolve it by NLP technique.

The models that I have tried are:

- [ ] Bert
- [ ] TF-IDF + logistic regression
- [ ] TF-IDF + random forest

### Details

ðŸ“œanalysis.ipynb 

- The main analysis notebook, where a simple EDA was performed. Based on this notebook, we can know what kind of dataset out there, and also the basic statistics about the dataset. 

# Quick Tour 

To run the one-stop training pipeline, just simply go command prompt(windows) or terminal(linux), cd to the project parent folder, e.g. in my case, I saved the project in the directory of "D:\personal_git\6Estates_Project_Interview_CLS\6Estates_Project_Interview_Data_CLS"

```bash
 cd D:\personal_git\6Estates_Project_Interview_Data_CLS\
```

then type the python command as below:

```python
python -m src.datapipeline_6estate --config_path src/config_6estate.yml
```

# About analysis.ipynb 

The purpose of this notebook is to explore with the raw dataset, and to think of the idea or method on data processing, model building based on the findings. I will explain the works part by part below:

First, some basic statistics and useful findings from "EDA" part: 

- train sizeï¼š8636
- test size: 1066
- val size: 960
- Each dataset has two columns: "sentence" is the text data for classification; "label" is the response variable with 1 and 0 only.
- Seems label 1 represents positive comment, while label 0 represents negative comment.
- The machine learning model shall have 1 label only
- Basically the dataset is quite clean, e.g. perfect balanced labels, we don't have to deal with class imbalance problem. Also we can use binary accuracy to evaluate our model performance.
- There is no missing values and duplicates at all. 
- Seems all texts in lower case by simple eyeballing.
- There are some phrase contractions found -> we can expand them to improve the model's performance.
- There are some non-English words -> we need to remove them to avoid noise interference.

Second, some basic data cleaning steps performed on "Data Cleaning" part:

- Remove non-English examples by python library "langdetect" + eyeballing e.g. 51 examples removed from train set.
- Expand contractions by regular expression. I did not use package to expand as most of the packages requires long processing time.
- Process data by "DataPipeline", please refer to the "DataPipeline" section for more details

Third, I tried TF-IDF model to compare it's performance with NN model.

TF-IDF is an simple and time efficient way of analyzing text data. The drawbacks is very obvious - it cannot analyze the relationship between words, also it ignores the sequence, context and grammar completely. since it is time efficient, we can take it as the benchmark of this project.

I have tried two of the most commonly used model, and below are their performance(accuracy):

- TF-IDF + logistic regression: 0.5103

- TF-IDF + random forest: 0.5281

# About datapipeline_6estate.py

This is the core pipeline for data cleaning and modelling.

There are two classes that can be imported to use: "DataPipeline" and "Model"

- "DataPipeline" is a one-stop cleaning pipeline built for general pre-processing of train, test, val or any other datasets from raw text data into cleaned text data.

- "Model" is a wrapper for HuggingFace distilled BERT model. I have chosen the distilled BERT model as it is the most advanced bidirectional NLP model with outstanding performance in language understanding. The benefit of BERT is that it can understand the grammar, context, sequence and punctuations apart from word itself. As the dataset is not big in size, a smaller/distilled version of the model is sufficient.

# About experiment_6estate.py

Due to the limited compute resource that my laptop can render, I have to train the BERT model on cloud - Polyaxon platform, built on kubernetes cluster.

The "experiment_6estate.py" is the instruction code to run Polyaxon training experiment.

The basic steps involved in this experiment:

- Setup logger and storing path according to current timing.
- Run DataPipeline and model
- Save training results, running information and trained model

In addition, to run Polyaxon experiment, we also need the config files below:

- conda.yml - to install required libraries

- experiment.df - dockerfile to setup running environment

- experiment.yml - pass config parameters

- link_workspace.sh - connect persistent storage on Polyaxon

- config_6estate.yml - pass all runtime parameters for DataPipeline and Model
